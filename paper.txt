#+Title: Modeling Zinc-modulation of NMDAR signaling in L2/3 pyramidal cell

* Key Points

[[Figure {model-description} around here]]

\item We derive a model for the modulation of synaptic transmission through NMDA receptor channels due to the binding of endogeneously-released Zinc. 
\item We calibrate the model parameters on \textit{in vitro} intracellular recordings of L2/3 pyramidal cells. We use a combination of extracellular stimulation experiments and paired intracellular recordings to calibrate respectively the biophysical parameters and the pathway-specificty of the Zinc modulation.
\item We investigate the functional impact of the Zinc modulation for the computation performed by Layer 2/3 pyramidal cells during \textit{in vivo}-like regimes of cortical activity (strong synaptic bombardment). 
\item We find that, while NMDAR in L2/3 cells is strongly involved in shaping the response to both L4 and L2/3 synaptic stimulation, For L4->L2/3 synaptic stimulation, the Zinc-independent recruitment of NMDAR implements a background-facilitating encoding of stimulus intensity. On the other hand, the strong Zinc modulation characterizing L2/3 synapses implements a background-invariant encoding of stimulus intensity. 

* Results

*** Modeling Zinc-modulation of NMDAR signaling

We derive a model of the Zinc modulation of NMDAR signaling based on our experimental observations and previous studies (Vergnano et al., 2014, ...). Our modeling approach aimed at describing the modulation in the form of a minimal phenomenological description at the single synapse level (see Discussion). 

The phenomenology and the reasoning guiding the derivation of the model were the following (illustrated in Figure {model-description}). Glutamatergic events are associated to a release of Zinc in the synaptic cleft. Zinc has a high affinity for binding and does not accumulate in the cleft (the cleft is free of Zinc in less than 2ms, REF), so the dynamics is led by the binding-unbinding phenomenon. Zinc binding is modelled by a variable $b_{Zn}$ varying betweeen 0 (no binding) and 1 (full binding). Zinc binding is approximated as instantaneous and fully saturating the binding site at every single synaptic release event (see the systematic jump to $b_Zn$=1 after glutamatergic events in Figure {model-description}a). Zinc unbinding has a decay time constant $\tau^{decay}_{Zn}$. At the time of a synaptic release, the current level of Zinc binding will determine the magnitude of the reduction of NMDA conductance due to the Zinc modulation. The factor modulating the NMDA conductance $m_{Zn}(t)$ is therefore a piecewise time-varying function updated to the $b_{Zn}$ level at every synaptic release (see the thick dashed curve in Figure {model-description}a). Finally, a parameter $\alpha_{Zn}$ captures the inhibitory efficacy of Zinc binding on NMDAR conductance. At full binding ($b_{Zn}$=1), the NMDA conductance has a factor 1-$\alpha_{Zn}$.
The Zinc modulation is therefore summarized by the dependency: $g_{NMDA} \propto (1 - \alpha_{Zn} \cdot m_{Zn})$, see Equation {nmda} in the Methods.

We implemented the above mechanism into simulations of single cell dynamics in detailed morphological structures (Stimberg et al., 2019). See the associated \href{https://github.com/yzerlaut/zinc-NMDA-modulation/blob/master/single_cell_sim.py}{Script}. We used a publicly available morphology of mouse Layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron (Jiang et al., 2015). Such a model allowed to reproduce synaptic stimulation coupled with either voltage-clamp protocols (see Methods) as un our experimental recordings, we used this property to  to calibrate the parameters introduced by our theoretical description (see next section). Otherwise, we fixed biophysical and synaptic parameters to previously used values (Destexhe et al., 1998; Koch, 2004, Farinella et al., 2014). The model parameters are summarized on Table {model-params}.

The resulting model implementation was found to reproduce the results of Branco et al. (2011), see the \href{https://github.com/yzerlaut/zinc-NMDA-modulation/blob/master/Branco-et-al-2011.ipynb}{Notebook} and underlying \href{https://github.com/yzerlaut/zinc-NMDA-modulation/blob/master/branco-et-al-2011.py}{Script}.

*** Calibrating model parameters on \textit{in vitro} intracellular recordings of L2/3 pyramidal cells

The model calibration consisted in three successive steps, we determined: 1) the passive properties, 2) the biophysical parameters of the Zinc modulation phenomenon, 3) the pathway specificity of the Zinc modulation.

\paragraph*{Passive properties}

We first calibrated the passive properties of the model: the membrane leak conductance $g_l$ and the membrane capacitance $c_m$ (see Table {model-params}). We used our set of current-clamp experimental recordings to determine the input resistance and capacitance at the soma (see Methods). The experimental values were found to be {exp-passive-props} (see Figure {passive-props}).

In the model, we varied the passive parameters and computed the input resistance and capacitance at the soma. This was achieved by fitting the $V_m$ response to the single compartment response following a 200 pA current step. The range for the parameter parameter variation was $g_L \in $ [{gL_min},{gL_max}]pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and $c_m \in$ [{cm_min},{cm_max}]$\mu$F/cm$^2$ on a [{N_gL}x{N_cm}] regular grid, see Figure {passive-props}a). The joint minimization (via the product of the normalized square residual) of the somatic $R_m$ and $C_m$ in the model led to the parameters $g_L$={gL}pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and $c_m$={cm}$\mu$F/cm$^2$, similar to previous analysis of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in mice sensory cortex (Branco and HÃ¤usser, 2011; Palmer et al., 2014).

\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Biophysical parameters of Zinc modulation}



We calibrated the model parameters on our set of voltage-clamp recordings following extracellular stimulation at 20Hz and 3Hz (see "data" in Figure {biophysical-calib-1}). 
Methods, Figure {optimization}a,b,c and Table {model-params}). After parameter optimization, the error between model and experiment for the "chelation"-effect (defined by the residual trace: chelated - control) only represented
 # {MAPE_chelation_model_exp}
 of the experimentally recorded variations (see Figure {optimization}d), we therefore conclude that our theoretical description successfully captured the experimentally observed modulation of NMDAR signalling by endogeneous Zinc.

*** Zinc modulation of NMDAR critically shapes the background dependency of the stimulus encoding

\begin{itemize}
\item The Zinc-modulated recruitment of NMDAR implements a background-invariant encoding of stimulus intensity for L2/3->L2/3 synaptic 
\item The Zinc-independent recruitment of NMDAR implements a background-facilitating encoding of L4->L2/3 synaptic stimulation
\end{itemize}

We then embed this model in a background of synaptic activity and examined how the Zinc modulation mechanism affect the NMDA events following diverse sets of synchronized synaptic events, see Figure {model-prediction}.

*** Numerical simulations of morphologically-detailed L2/3 pyramidal cells

Single cell integration was simulated using the cable equation (Rall, 1962; Koch, 2004):

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_i} \frac{\partial^2 V_m}{\partial x^2} = i_m = c_m \frac{\partial V_m}{\partial t} + \frac{V_m-E_L}{r_m} - i_{I}
\end{equation}

where the membrane current $i_m$ and the input currents $i_I$ are linear density of currents. The cable equation parameters are derived from the membrane parameters of Table {model-params} by applying the radial symmetry (for a segment of diameter $D$: $r_m=\frac{1}{\pi D G_L}$, $c_m=\pi D C_m$, , $r_i=\frac{4 R_i}{\pi D^2}$). 

Additional point currents (synaptic inputs and/or "voltage-clamp"-currents) are inserted in a segment through the $i_I$ term (as $i_I=I/l_S$ for a current $I$ and a segment of length $l_S$).

For voltage-clamp protocols, the leak conductance $g_L$ was decreased by a factor {VC-gL-reduction-factor} (to reproduce the Cesium block), an additional point current $I_{clamp} = g_{clamp} \cdot (V_{cmd} - V_m)$ of clamping conductance {VC-gclamp}$\mu$S was inserted at the soma, an additional {VC-discard-time}ms were added prior to stimulation to reach stationary "clamp" conditions (initialized at $V_{cmd}$) and we report the $I_{amp}$ quantity after those {VC-discard-time}ms (see Figure {model-description}).

The simulations were implemented using the \textit{Brian2} simulator (Stimberg et al., 2019). Numerical integration was performed with an "exponential Euler" integration scheme and a time step of {dt}ms.

The morphology of the layer 2/3 pyramidal cell used in this study ("L23pyr-j150407a", see Figure {model-description}b) was taken from the publicly available dataset of Jiang et al. (2015). 

*** Synaptic current models

We consider 3 types of synaptic transmission in this study: NMDA, AMPA and GABA. For all synaptic types, the temporal profile of the synaptically-evoked conductance variations was made of a double exponential waveform (Destexhe et al., 1998; Koch, 2004):
\begin{equation}
F_{syn} : t \rightarrow A_{syn} \cdot (e^{-t/\tau^{decay}_{syn}} - e^{-t/\tau^{rise}_{syn}} ) 
\end{equation}
where $\tau^{rise}_{syn}$ and  $\tau^{decay}_{syn}$ are the rise and a decay time constant respectively. The waveform was normalized to peak leevel with the factor: 
\begin{equation}
A_{syn} = \frac{\tau^{rise}_{syn}}{\tau^{decay}_{syn}-\tau^{rise}_{syn}} \cdot (\tau^{decay}_{syn}/\tau^{rise}_{syn})^{\frac{\tau^{decay}_{syn}}{\tau^{decay}_{syn}-\tau^{rise}_{syn}}}
\end{equation}

For a GABA or AMPA synapse activated by a set of events $\{t^k\}$ located at position $i$ (of membrane potential $V_m^i$), the synaptic current I^i_{syn} reads:

\begin{equation}
I^i_{syn}(t, V_m^i) = q_{syn} \cdot (E_{syn} - V_m^i) \cdot \sum_{ \{t_k\} } \mathcal{H}(t-t_k) \, F_{syn}(t-t_k)
\end{equation}

where $q_{syn}$ is the conductance quantal of the synaptic release (setting the peak conductance level) and $\mathcal{H}(t)$ is the Heaviside (step) function. We measured AMPA and NMDA peak currents to determine the ratio of NMDA to AMPA conductances (see Figure {nmda-ampa}), this ratio was used to set the NMDA conductance quantal from the AMPA conductance quantal (see Table {model-params}).

For NMDA synapses, we add a voltage-dependency due to the Magnesium block captured by an exponential function (Ascher and Nowak, 1988; Jahr and Stevens, 1990; Koch, 2004) and a Zinc-binding dependency (detailed in the next section):

[[Figure {nmda-ampa} around here]]

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nmda}
\begin{split}
& I^i_{NMDA} (t, V_m^i, b^i_{Zn}) = \big(1 - \alpha_{Zn} \, m_{Zn} \big) 
\cdot \frac{1}{1+ \eta \, [\text{Mg}^{2+}] e^{- V_m^i / V_0 }}  \\ 
& \qquad \times q_{NMDA} \, (E_{NMDA} - V_m^i) \sum_{ \{t_k\} } \mathcal{H}(t-t_k) \, F_{NMDA}(t-t_k)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The voltage-dependency parameters were fixed to $\eta$={etaMg}mM$^{-1}$, $V_0$={V0NMDA}mV and the Magnesium concentration as $[\text{Mg}^{2+}]$={cMg}mM (Farinella et al., 2014). 

All synaptic parameters are summarized on Table {model-params}.

*** Zinc modulation model

The modulation factor $m_{Zn}$ that scales the NMDA conductance, see $g_{NMDA} \propto (1- \alpha_{Zn} \cdot m_{Zn})$ in Equation {nmda}, is determined by the level of Zinc binding at the time of the synaptic event. Therefore, for a set of glutamatergic events $\{t^k\}_{glut}$, the time-varying factor $m_{Zn}$ is defined by the piecewise function:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mZn}
 m_{Zn} : t \req \rightarrow b_{Zn}(t^k) \qquad \forall t \in [t^k, t^{k+1}[
\end{equation}

The variable $b_{Zn}(t)$ describes the dynamics of Zinc binding. It is updated to fully-bound level ($b_{Zn}$=1) at each glutamatergic event and decays to the unbound level ($b_{Zn}$=0) with a time constant $\tau^{decay}_{Zn}$. It therefore follows the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bZn}
\tau^{decay}_{Zn} \cdot \frac{d b_{Zn}}{ dt }  = & - b_{Zn} + (1-b_{Zn}) \cdot \sum_{\{t^{k}\}_{glut}} \delta (t-t^k)
\end{equation}

The dynamics of the $b_{Zn}$ and $m_{Zn}$ variables following synaptic events is illustrated on Figure {model-description}a.

*** Model calibration: parameter fitting

The parameter of the model were fitted in three steps (respectively shown in *a*, *b* and *c* in Figure {optimization}) yielding the constrained model shown in Figure {optimization}d). 

First, we determined the passive properties of the model using our experimental characterization of somatic input resistance and capacitance in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells: {exp-passive-props}. Those values were obtained by fitting (using the \texttt{minimize} function of the \texttt{scipy} module) the response to current steps in a our current-clamp recordings. We varied the passive parameters in the model and computed the input resistance at the soma (by fitting the $V_m$ response to a 200 pA current step). The range for the parameter grid was [{gL_min},{gL_max}]pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and [{cm_min},{cm_max}]$\mu$F/cm$^2$ on a [{N_gL}x{N_cm}] regular grid, see Figure {passive-props}a. The joint minimization (via the product of the normalized square residual) of the somatic $R_m$ and $C_m$ in the model led to the parameters $g_L$={gL}pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and $c_m$={cm}$\mu$F/cm$^2$, similar to previous analysis of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in mice sensory cortex (Branco and HÃ¤usser, 2011; Palmer et al., 2014).

We then used our set of voltage-clamp recordings with extracellular stimulation at 20Hz and 3Hz to constraint the Zinc-dependent NMDAR model (optimizing the product of the normalized residual traces at 20Hz and 3Hz between model and experiment). 

The second step consisted in using the "chelated-Zinc" condition to evaluate the NMDAR kinetics ($\tau_{decay}^{NMDA}$) and to find the correlate in the model of the extracellular stimulation protocol. We described the electrical stimulation as a number of activated synapses $N_{syn}$ decreasing with stimulation time (to capture the decreasing efficacy of the electrical stimulation, see Figure {optimization}d): $N_{syn}: t \rightarrow (N_{syn}^0-N_{syn}^\infty) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{Nsyn}} + N_{syn}^\infty$. We varied the parameters in the range $\tau_{decay}^{NMDA}$ in [{tauDecayNMDA_min},{tauDecayNMDA_max}]ms,  $N_{syn}^{0}$ $\in$ $[{Nsyn1_min},{Nsyn1_max}]$ synapses $N_{syn}^{\infty}$ $\in$ $[{Nsyn2_min},{Nsyn2_max}]$ synapses
and $\tau_{Nsyn}$ $\in$ [{Tnsyn20Hz_min},{Tnsyn20Hz_max}]ms on a [{N_tauDecayNMDA}x{N_Nsyn1}x{N_Nsyn2}x{N_Tnsyn20Hz}] linear grid. This minimization is shown in Figure {optimization}b,d and the best fit model was found for: 

As a third step, we used the "free-Zinc condition" to determine the Zinc-modulation parameters of the NMDAR model introduced above ($\alpha_{Zn}$, $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$, $\tau_{Zn}^{decay}$, $\Delta_x^0$, $\delta_x$). We varied the Zinc parameters in the range $\alpha_{Zn}$ $\in$ [{alphaZn_min},{alphaZn_max}], $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$ $\in$ [{tauRiseZn_min},{tauRiseZn_max}]ms, $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$ $\in$ [{tauDecayZn_min},{tauDecayZn_max}]ms, $\Delta_x^0$ $\in$ [{Deltax0_min},{Deltax0_max}] and $\delta x$ $\in$ [{deltax_min},{deltax_max}] on a [{N_alphaZn}x{N_tauRiseZn}x{N_tauDecayZn}x{N_Deltax0}x{N_deltax}] linear grid. This minimization is shown in Figure {optimization}c,d. The best fit model was found for: $\alpha_{Zn}$={alphaZn}, $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$={tauRiseZn}, $\tau_{Zn}^{decay}$={tauDecayZn}, $\Delta_x^0$={Deltax0} and $\delta x$={deltax}.

We calibrated the model parameters on our set of voltage-clamp recordings following extracellular stimulation at 20Hz and 3Hz. We varied the parameters of the Zinc-modulation model on a regular grid and computed the square residual of the model predictions for all parameters. 


*** Background synaptic noise and response estimate

Background synaptic noise was generated by independent Poisson point
processed at each synapse. The simulations were repeated over
different seeds (see Figure legends) and the single-trial $V_m$s were
averaged over seeds to yield the $V_m$ response.

To prevent residual noise (after seed-averaging) to contaminate our area estimate of $V_m$
response, we fitted the parameters ($A_0, A_1, \tau_1, \tau_2, t_2$)
of the function:
\begin{equation}
f(t) = A_0 + A_1 \cdot \mathcal{H}(t) \cdot \big( 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_1}} - \erf(\frac{t-t_2}{\tau_1}) \big)
\end{equation}
to each $V_m$ response and reported the area of the fitted function
(see Figure XX). Note that this function $f$ has the ability to
capture both classic PSP response (see "AMPA-only" case in Figure XX) and PSP responses with transient plateau depolarizations (see "chelated-Zinc" case in Figure XX).

*** Data analysis

All data analysis and visualization was performed using the \texttt{python} ecosystem for scientific computing using the \texttt{numpy}  (Harris et al., 2020), \texttt{scipy} (Virtanen et al., 2020) and \texttt{matplotlib} (Hunter, 2007) modules.

* Discussion

How Zinc modulation at NMDAR synapse emerge from molecular dynamics has been studied theoretically in Vergnano et al. (2014), here we provide a complementary description, we derived and calibrated a phenomenological model at the single synapse level. Such model allow to study cellular integration at the whole cell level (see Figure {model-description}, Figure {}).

By applying patterned, two-photon glutamate uncaging, we found that single dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity to the sequence of synaptic activation. This sensitivity is encoded by both local dendritic calcium signals and somatic depolarization, leading to sequence-selective spike output. The mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in different neuronal types. This enables discrimination of patterns delivered to a single dendrite, as well as patterns distributed randomly across the dendritic tree. Pyramidal cell dendrites can thus act as processing compartments for the detection of synaptic sequences, thereby implementing a fundamental cortical computation.},

*** Estimating the ratio of NMDA to AMPA synaptic conductances.

See Figure {nmda-ampa}.

*** Fitting passive properties

In the model, we varied the passive parameters and computed the input resistance and capacitance at the soma. This was achieved by fitting the $V_m$ response to the single compartment response following a 200 pA current step. The range for the parameter parameter variation was $g_L \in $ [{gL_min},{gL_max}]pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and $c_m \in$ [{cm_min},{cm_max}]$\mu$F/cm$^2$ on a [{N_gL}x{N_cm}] regular grid, see Figure {passive-props}a). The joint minimization (via the product of the normalized square residual) of the somatic $R_m$ and $C_m$ in the model led to the parameters $g_L$={gL}pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and $c_m$={cm}$\mu$F/cm$^2$, similar to previous analysis of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in mice sensory cortex (Branco and HÃ¤usser, 2011; Palmer et al., 2014).

*** Model description
We next introduce a biophysical model for the modulation of synaptic transmission due to Zinc binding (illustrated on Figure {model-description}a). 

The maximum conductance following a synaptic event is set by the following product: **a)** A conductance quantal setting the maximum conductance at full-activation level , **b)** a voltage-dependent term (Mg block), **c)** a Zn$^{2+}$-inhibition term set as $\big(1 - \alpha_{Zn} \, b_{Zn} \big)$ where $\alpha_{Zn}$ is the fraction of inhibited conductance at maximum binding level ($b_{Zn}$=1).

We show on Figure {model-description}c, the model prediction for a situation analogous to (Fig. Exp ...). A set of 5 glutamatergic synapses is synchronously activated

We thus get the $b_{Zn}$ variable. 
 Because Zinc binding is mostly constrained by the binding-unbinding dynamics, the relation between Glutamamte release and the increments of Zinc binding should be non-linear (in the alternative scenario where)

The bounded-Zinc variable fully describes the phenomenon, without any other underlying dynamics, the temporal dynamics applies to that specific variable. At each synaptic event, Zinc is released and increments the effective-binding variable (bZn), each increment is followed by a decay to model the unbinding dynamics. Here, the on-linearity is model by a state-dependent (bZn-dependent) increment of the bounded-Zn variable (bZn), the higher bZn, the lower the increment (to produce the saturation up to 1).

 (and not by the value of a hidden Zinc concentration . This imposes the introduction of an underlying state-depedent variable $x$

translated into a state-dependent integration variable $x$ (the $x$-dependency of the $\Delta x$ increments is shown in the inset, grey line). The $x$ variable is then non-linearly transformed and low-pass filtered to give the Zinc-binding variable $b_{Zn}$ (see the sigmoid in the inset, black line). Zinc binding reduces the NMDA synaptic conductance ($g_{NMDA}$, top plot), at full-binding $b_{Zn}=1$, the conductance is reduced by a factor $\alpha_{Zn}$. The increment parameter of the model $\Delta x^0$ is set to 0 when there is no available Zinc ("chelated-Zinc", green lines). The equation capturing this is Equation {Zn-modul} and is depicted in Figure {model-description}a.
