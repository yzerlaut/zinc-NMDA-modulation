*** Modeling Zinc-modulation of NMDAR signaling

We now derive a model of the Zinc modulation of NMDAR signaling based on the above observations and previous studies (Vergnano et al., 2014, ...). Our modeling approach aimed at describing the modulation in the form of a minimal phenomenological description at the single synapse level (see Discussion). 

The phenomenology and the reasoning guiding the derivation of the model were the following (illustrated in Figure {model-description}a). Glutamatergic events are associated to Zinc release in the synaptic cleft. Zinc has a high affinity for binding and does not accumulate in the cleft (the cleft is free of Zinc in less than 2ms, REF), so the dynamics is led by the binding-unbinding phenomenon. Zinc binding is modelled by a variable $b_{Zn}$ varying betweeen 0 (no binding) and 1 (full binding). A parameter $\alpha_{Zn}$ captures the inhibitory efficacy of Zinc binding on NMDAR conductance. At full binding ($b_{Zn}$=1), the NMDA conductance has a factor 1-$\alpha_{Zn}$. Zinc binding as an inertia captured by a time constant $\tau^{rise}_{Zn}$. Zinc unbinding has a decay time constant $\tau^{decay}_{Zn}$. Zinc binding is a non-linear phenomenon, from Vergnano et al. (2014), we extrapolate that the relation between available Zinc (upon synaptic release) and Zinc binding should be captured by a sigmoid function. This non-linearity is implemented in two-steps. First the relation between Glutamate release and the increments of Zinc binding are state-dependent and bounded to 1, we therefore introduce an intermediate variable $x$ that is incremented at synaptic events (see Figure {model-description}a). Second, we apply the sigmoid function on that variable to enforce the non-linear behavior of Zinc-binding (to display full binding level for sustained inputs, see Figure {model-description}a). Finally, we low-pass filter this signal to add the binding dynamics. The two-dimensional system of equations implementing those steps is Equation {Zn-modul}.

We implemented the above mechanism into simulations of single cell dynamics in detailed morphological structures (Stimberg et al., 2019). We used a publicly available morphology of mouse Layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron (Jiang et al., 2015) and we fixed biophysical parameters (beside NMDA and Zinc-modulation parameters) to previously used values (Destexhe et al., 1998; Koch, 2004, Farinella et al., 2014). 

This model allowed to implement synaptic stimulation coupled with current-clamp and voltage-clamp recording protocols similar to our experimental recordings (see Methods). We therefore calibrated the model parameters on our set of voltage-clamp recordings following extracellular stimulation at 20Hz and 3Hz (see Methods, Figure {optimization}a,b,c and Table {model-params}). After parameter optimization, the error between model and experiment for the "chelation"-effect (defined by the residual trace: chelated - control) only represented {MAPE_chelation_model_exp} of the experimentally recorded variations (see Figure {optimization}d), we therefore conclude that our theoretical description successfully captured the experimentally observed modulation of NMDAR signalling by endogeneous Zinc.

To examine the validity of this theoretical description against our experimental observations, we incorporated 


*** Zinc modulation restrict the temporal window of NMDA events / shifts NMDA spike threshold.

We then embed this model in a background of synaptic activity and examined how the Zinc modulation mechanism affect the NMDA events following diverse sets of synchronized synaptic events, see Figure {model-prediction}.

*** Numerical simulations of morphologically-detailed L2/3 pyramidal cells

Single cell integration was simulated using the cable equation (Rall, 1962; Koch, 2004):

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_i} \frac{\partial^2 V_m}{\partial x^2} = i_m = c_m \frac{\partial V_m}{\partial t} + \frac{V_m-E_L}{r_m} - i_{I}
\end{equation}

where the membrane current $i_m$ and the input currents $i_I$ are linear density of currents. The cable equation parameters are derived from the membrane parameters of Table {model-params} by applying the radial symmetry (for a segment of diameter $D$: $r_m=\frac{1}{\pi D G_L}$, $c_m=\pi D C_m$, , $r_i=\frac{4 R_i}{\pi D^2}$). 

Additional point currents (synaptic inputs and/or "voltage-clamp"-currents) are inserted in a segment through the $i_I$ term (as $i_I=I/l_S$ for a current of amplitude $I$ and a segment of length $l_S$).

For voltage-clamp protocols, the leak conductance $g_L$ was decreased by a factor {VC-gL-reduction-factor} (to reproduce the Cesium block), an additional point current $I_{clamp} = g_{clamp} \cdot (V_{cmd} - V_m)$ of clamping conductance {VC-gclamp}$\mu$S was inserted at the soma, an additional {VC-discard-time}ms were added prior to stimulation to reach stationary "clamp" conditions (initialized at $V_{cmd}$) and we report the $I_{amp}$ quantity after those {VC-discard-time}ms (see Figure {model-description}).

The simulations were implemented using the \textit{Brian2} simulator (Stimberg et al., 2019). Numerical integration was performed with an "exponential Euler" integration scheme and a time step of {dt}ms.

The morphology of the layer 2/3 pyramidal cell used in this study ("L23pyr-j150407a", see Figure {model-description}b) was taken from the publicly available dataset of Jiang et al. (2015). 

*** Synaptic current models

We consider 3 types of synaptic transmission in this study: NMDA, AMPA and GABA. For all synaptic types, the temporal profile of the synaptically-evoked conductance variations was made of a double exponential waveform (Destexhe et al., 1998; Koch, 2004):
\begin{equation}
F_{syn} : t \rightarrow A_{syn} \cdot (e^{-t/\tau^{decay}_{syn}} - e^{-t/\tau^{rise}_{syn}} ) 
\end{equation}
where $\tau^{rise}_{syn}$ and  $\tau^{decay}_{syn}$ are the rise and a decay time constant respectively. The waveform was normalized to peak leevel with the factor: 
\begin{equation}
A_{syn} = \frac{\tau^{rise}_{syn}}{\tau^{decay}_{syn}-\tau^{rise}_{syn}} \cdot (\tau^{decay}_{syn}/\tau^{rise}_{syn})^{\frac{\tau^{decay}_{syn}}{\tau^{decay}_{syn}-\tau^{rise}_{syn}}}
\end{equation}

For a GABA or AMPA synapse activated by a set of events $\{t^k\}$ located at position $i$ (of membrane potential $V_m^i$), the synaptic current I^i_{syn} reads:

\begin{equation}
I^i_{syn}(t, V_m^i) = q_{syn} \cdot (E_{syn} - V_m^i) \cdot \sum_{ \{t_k\} } \mathcal{H}(t-t_k) \, F_{syn}(t-t_k)
\end{equation}

where $q_{syn}$ is the conductance quantal of the synaptic release (setting the peak conductance level) and $\mathcal{H}(t)$ is the Heaviside (step) function. We measured AMPA and NMDA peak currents to determine the ratio of NMDA to AMPA conductances (see Figure {nmda-ampa}), this ratio was used to set the NMDA conductance quantal from the AMPA conductance quantal (see Table {model-params}).

For NMDA synapses, we add a Zinc-binding dependency (detailed in the next section) and a voltage-dependency due to the Magnesium block captured by an exponential function (Ascher and Nowak, 1988; Jahr and Stevens, 1990; Koch, 2004):

[[Figure {nmda-ampa} around here]]

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nmda}
\begin{split}
& I^i_{NMDA} (t, V_m^i, b^i_{Zn}) = \big(1 - \alpha_{Zn} \, b_{Zn} \big) 
\cdot \frac{1}{1+ \eta \, [\text{Mg}^{2+}] e^{- V_m^i / V_0 }}  \\ 
& \qquad \times q_{NMDA} \, (E_{NMDA} - V_m^i) \sum_{ \{t_k\} } \mathcal{H}(t-t_k) \, F_{NMDA}(t-t_k)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The voltage-dependency parameters were fixed to $\eta$={etaMg}mM$^{-1}$, $V_0$={V0NMDA}mV and the Magnesium concentration as $[\text{Mg}^{2+}]$={cMg}mM (Farinella et al., 2014). 

All synaptic parameters are summarized on Table {model-params}.

*** Zinc modulation model

The system of equation setting the dynamics of the binding variable $b_{Zn}$ in the NMDA conductance (Equation {eq:nmda}) reads:
    
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Zn-modul}
\left\{
\begin{split}
\tau^{decay}_{Zn} \cdot \frac{d x}{ dt }  = & - x + \Delta_x ( x )  \sum_{\{t^{k}\}_{glut}} \delta (t-t^k) \\
\tau^{rise}_{Zn} \cdot \frac{d b_{Zn}}{ dt }  = & - b_{Zn} + \mathcal{S}(\frac{x-x_0}{\delta x}) 
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

where $\Delta_x (x)$ is the ($x$-dependent) increment defined by  $\Delta_x : x \rightarrow \Delta_x^0 \cdot \big(1- x \big)$. The function $\mathcal{S}$ is the sigmoid function defined by: $\mathcal{S} : X \rightarrow \frac{1}{1+e^{-X}}$, the parameters $x_0$ and $\delta x$ therefore define the center and slope of the sigmoid. To limit the number of free parameters, the parameter $x_0$ was constrained to $x_0$=$\Delta_x^0$, meaning that the sigmoid of the Zinc-modulation activation was centered around one the increment corresponding to one synaptic event (see Figure {model-description}a). Such constraint did not prevent an accurate quantitative description of the effect (see Figure {optimization}d).

*** Model calibration: parameter fitting

[[Figure {optimization} around here]]

The parameter of the model were fitted in three steps (respectively shown in *a*, *b* and *c* in Figure {optimization}) yielding the constrained model shown in Figure {optimization}d). 

First, we determined the passive properties of the model using our experimental characterization of somatic input resistance and capacitance in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells: $R_m$={Rm_exp}, $C_m$={Cm_exp} (n={ncell_RmCm} cells). The range for the parameter grid was [{gL_min},{gL_max}]pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and [{cm_min},{cm_max}]$\mu$F/cm$^2$ on a [{N_gL}x{N_cm}] regular grid, see Figure {optimization}a). The joint minimization (via the product of the normalized square residual) of the somatic $R_m$ and $C_m$ in the model led to the parameters $g_L$={gL}pS/$\mu$m$^2$ and $c_m$={cm}$\mu$F/cm$^2$, similar to previous analysis of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in mice sensory cortex (Branco and Häusser, 2011; Palmer et al., 2014).

We then used our set of voltage-clamp recordings with extracellular stimulation at 20Hz and 3Hz to constraint the Zinc-dependent NMDAR model (optimizing the product of the normalized residual traces at 20Hz and 3Hz between model and experiment). 

The second step consisted in using the "chelated-Zinc" condition to evaluate the NMDAR kinetics ($\tau_{decay}^{NMDA}$) and to find the correlate in the model of the extracellular stimulation protocol. We described the electrical stimulation as a number of activated synapses $N_{syn}$ decreasing with stimulation time (to capture the decreasing efficacy of the electrical stimulation, see Figure {optimization}d): $N_{syn}: t \rightarrow (N_{syn}^0-N_{syn}^\infty) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_{Nsyn}} + N_{syn}^\infty$. We varied the parameters in the range $\tau_{decay}^{NMDA}$ in [{tauDecayNMDA_min},{tauDecayNMDA_max}]ms,  $N_{syn}^{0}$ $\in$ $[{Nsyn1_min},{Nsyn1_max}]$ synapses $N_{syn}^{\infty}$ $\in$ $[{Nsyn2_min},{Nsyn2_max}]$ synapses
and $\tau_{Nsyn}$ $\in$ [{Tnsyn20Hz_min},{Tnsyn20Hz_max}]ms on a [{N_tauDecayNMDA}x{N_Nsyn1}x{N_Nsyn2}x{N_Tnsyn20Hz}] linear grid. This minimization is shown in Figure {optimization}b,d and the best fit model was found for: 

As a third step, we used the "free-Zinc condition" to determine the Zinc-modulation parameters of the NMDAR model introduced above ($\alpha_{Zn}$, $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$, $\tau_{Zn}^{decay}$, $\Delta_x^0$, $\delta_x$). We varied the Zinc parameters in the range $\alpha_{Zn}$ $\in$ [{alphaZn_min},{alphaZn_max}], $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$ $\in$ [{tauRiseZn_min},{tauRiseZn_max}]ms, $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$ $\in$ [{tauDecayZn_min},{tauDecayZn_max}]ms, $\Delta_x^0$ $\in$ [{Deltax0_min},{Deltax0_max}] and $\delta x$ $\in$ [{deltax_min},{deltax_max}] on a [{N_alphaZn}x{N_tauRiseZn}x{N_tauDecayZn}x{N_Deltax0}x{N_deltax}] linear grid. This minimization is shown in Figure {optimization}c,d. The best fit model was found for: $\alpha_{Zn}$={alphaZn}, $\tau_{Zn}^{rise}$={tauRiseZn}, $\tau_{Zn}^{decay}$={tauDecayZn}, $\Delta_x^0$={Deltax0} and $\delta x$={deltax}.

We calibrated the model parameters on our set of voltage-clamp recordings following extracellular stimulation at 20Hz and 3Hz. We varied the parameters of the Zinc-modulation model on a regular grid and computed the square residual of the model predictions for all parameters. 


*** Background synaptic noise and response estimate

Background synaptic noise was generated by independent Poisson point
processed at each synapse. The simulations were repeated over
different seeds (see Figure legends) and the single-trial $V_m$s were
averaged over seeds to yield the $V_m$ response.

To prevent residual noise (after seed-averaging) to contaminate our area estimate of $V_m$
response, we fitted the parameters ($A_0, A_1, \tau_1, \tau_2, t_2$)
of the function:
\begin{equation}
f(t) = A_0 + A_1 \cdot \mathcal{H}(t) \cdot \big( 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_1}} - \erf(\frac{t-t_2}{\tau_1}) \big)
\end{equation}
to each $V_m$ response and reported the area of the fitted function
(see Figure XX). Note that this function $f$ has the ability to
capture both classic PSP response (see "AMPA-only" case in Figure XX) and PSP responses with transient plateau depolarizations (see "chelated-Zinc" case in Figure XX).

(a) Biophysical model of NMDAR Zinc modulation at the single synapse level. Glutamate release is translated into a state-dependent integration variable $x$ (the $x$-dependency of the $\Delta x$ increments is shown in the inset, grey line). The $x$ variable is then non-linearly transformed and low-pass filtered to give the Zinc-binding variable $b_{Zn}$ (see the sigmoid in the inset, black line). Zinc binding reduces the NMDA synaptic conductance ($g_{NMDA}$, top plot), at full-binding $b_{Zn}=1$, the conductance is reduced by a factor $\alpha_{Zn}$. The increment parameter of the model $\Delta x^0$ is set to 0 when there is no available Zinc ("chelated-Zinc", green lines). (b) Morphological reconstruction of a Layer 2/3 pyramidal in the primary sensory cortex of the mouse (Jiang et al. (2015)). We highlight the soma (red circle) and the 5 glutamergic synapses on the basal dendite (orange dots) of panel *c*. (c) Voltage-clamp recordings in the model (see Methods) at four holding potentials following the synchronous stimulation of 5 glutamatergic synapses at 20Hz. We show the membrane potential (top plot, at the soma in red and at one synapse location in orange), the evoked conductances in one synapse (middle plot, AMPA and NMDA) and the recorded current at the soma (bottom). The green curves show the "chelated-Zinc" case ($\Delta_x^0$=0).

* Discussion

How Zinc modulation at NMDAR synapse emerge from molecular dynamics has been studied theoretically in Vergnano et al. (2014), here we provide a complementary description, we derived and calibrated a phenomenological model at the single synapse level. Such model allow to study cellular integration at the whole cell level (see Figure {model-description}, Figure {}).

By applying patterned, two-photon glutamate uncaging, we found that single dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity to the sequence of synaptic activation. This sensitivity is encoded by both local dendritic calcium signals and somatic depolarization, leading to sequence-selective spike output. The mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in different neuronal types. This enables discrimination of patterns delivered to a single dendrite, as well as patterns distributed randomly across the dendritic tree. Pyramidal cell dendrites can thus act as processing compartments for the detection of synaptic sequences, thereby implementing a fundamental cortical computation.},

*** Zinc modulation enables pathway-specific routing of information.

*** Model description
We next introduce a biophysical model for the modulation of synaptic transmission due to Zinc binding (illustrated on Figure {model-description}a). 

The maximum conductance following a synaptic event is set by the following product: **a)** A conductance quantal setting the maximum conductance at full-activation level , **b)** a voltage-dependent term (Mg block), **c)** a Zn$^{2+}$-inhibition term set as $\big(1 - \alpha_{Zn} \, b_{Zn} \big)$ where $\alpha_{Zn}$ is the fraction of inhibited conductance at maximum binding level ($b_{Zn}$=1).

We show on Figure {model-description}c, the model prediction for a situation analogous to (Fig. Exp ...). A set of 5 glutamatergic synapses is synchronously activated

We thus get the $b_{Zn}$ variable. 
 Because Zinc binding is mostly constrained by the binding-unbinding dynamics, the relation between Glutamamte release and the increments of Zinc binding should be non-linear (in the alternative scenario where)

The bounded-Zinc variable fully describes the phenomenon, without any other underlying dynamics, the temporal dynamics applies to that specific variable. At each synaptic event, Zinc is released and increments the effective-binding variable (bZn), each increment is followed by a decay to model the unbinding dynamics. Here, the on-linearity is model by a state-dependent (bZn-dependent) increment of the bounded-Zn variable (bZn), the higher bZn, the lower the increment (to produce the saturation up to 1).

 (and not by the value of a hidden Zinc concentration . This imposes the introduction of an underlying state-depedent variable $x$

translated into a state-dependent integration variable $x$ (the $x$-dependency of the $\Delta x$ increments is shown in the inset, grey line). The $x$ variable is then non-linearly transformed and low-pass filtered to give the Zinc-binding variable $b_{Zn}$ (see the sigmoid in the inset, black line). Zinc binding reduces the NMDA synaptic conductance ($g_{NMDA}$, top plot), at full-binding $b_{Zn}=1$, the conductance is reduced by a factor $\alpha_{Zn}$. The increment parameter of the model $\Delta x^0$ is set to 0 when there is no available Zinc ("chelated-Zinc", green lines). The equation capturing this is Equation {Zn-modul} and is depicted in Figure {model-description}a.
